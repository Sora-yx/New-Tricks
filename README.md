## About

This is a mod that tweaks the moveset of the characters and replace some of their actions, such as Rocket Accel with SA1 Spin Dash.
It also rework some moves like Amy propeller to be a lot faster and longer.

Features are all optional, so you can toggle whatever you like.

That's pretty much it for now.
